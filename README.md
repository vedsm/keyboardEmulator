# keyboardEmulator
Its a keyboard emulator which mimics a user writing on a keyboard, useful for simulating a person typing

#Direction
Change the string in stringToWrite and run the python code, place your cursor on the input text box 
and sit back and watch the magic happen.
(Useful TIP: include spaces at the start so that you don't miss out anything important while you are 
switching the cursor from running python to the input text box)

#Use
Can be used for fooling systems which don't allow large text to be copied and pasted. Or for screen recording videos in which you have to gradually show text but don't to type the text again and again.
